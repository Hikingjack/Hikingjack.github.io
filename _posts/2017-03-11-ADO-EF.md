# ADO.NET

> **1 - What is ADO.NET?**

- **Active Data Object** and **ADO.NET** is a set of .NET libraries for ADO. ADO.net Stands for Microsoft ActiveX Data Object.

- ADO.NET is a collection of managed libraries used by .NET applications for data source communication using a driver or provider. It is a database technology which we can think like a set of classes that can be used to interact with the data sources like databases and XML files.

- Enterprise applications handle a large amount of data. This data is primarily stored in relational databases, such as Oracle, SQL Server, and Access and so on. These databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for retrieval of data.

- To access enterprise data from a .NET application, an interface was needed. This interface acts as a **bridge** between an RDBMS system and a .NET application. ADO.NET is such an interface that is created to connect .NET applications to RDBMS systems.

- **Key Features:**

  - Disconnected Data Architecture.

  - Data cached in DataSet.

  - Scalability

  - Data transfer in XML Format.

  - Strongly typed language.

    

> **2 - What are the ADO.NET components?**

**Categorized in three modes: **

- disconnected (e.g. DataTable object)
- common or shared
- the.NET data providers.

![](/img/coding/ado.net.component.png)



> **3 - DataSet vs. DataTable?**

- A **DataSet** object falls in disconnected components series. The DataSet consists of a collection of `tables`, `rows`, `columns` and `relationships`. 

- **DataSet** contains a collection of **DataTables** _(`1 to n` relationship)_ and the DataTable contains a collection of `DataRows`, `DataRelations`, and `DataColumns`. 

- **DataTable** maps to a table in the database. The previous DataSet contains a DataTable that maps to the Orders table because you filled it with a SELECT query executed on the Order table.

  ![](/img/coding/ado.net.component.structure.png)

- Another thing you can do with the contents of your DataSet is `sort` and `filter` them using DataViews. You can have multiple Views of a dataset. A **DataView** is a view of your data created according to certain criteria. Each DataView has a one-to-one mapping to a DataTable in a
  DataSet.

  

> **4 - What are the differences Between DataReader and DataSet?**

| No   | Data Reader                                                  | DataSet                                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Connected architecture, stream-based.                        | Disconnected architecture.                                   |
| 2    | Better performance                                           | Lower performance                                            |
| 3    | Read-only access                                             | Read/Write access                                            |
| 4    | Supports a single table based on a single SQL query of one database. | Supports multiple tables from various databases.             |
| 5    | Must be manually coded                                       | Supported by visual studio tools                             |
| 6    | Cannot create a relation                                     | Can create relations                                         |
| 7    | Doesn't support data reader communicates with the command object | Supports integration with XML Dataset communicates with the DataAdapter only. |



> **5 - What is Connection Pooling?**

- Data providers implement **"Connection pooling"** services. Connection pooling improves performance. Connection pooling creates a set of connections.
- When you are establishing a connection with the database, you will be given a connection from a pool. When you disconnect from the database, the connection will return to the pool and that connection will be used by the next applicant who wants a connection. With **Connection pooling** the `opening` and `closing` of connections no longer become an expensive task.

![](/img/coding/connection_pooling.png)



> **6 - What is DataAdaptor? And feature?**

- DataAdapter helps in linking the database and connection object. It provides the communication between Dataset and data sources. 
- Data moves `in and out` of the Dataset through DataAdapter.



> **7 - What are different DataReaders for each DataProvider?**

- DataProviders are used for connecting to a database, retrieving data storing data, updating the data etc.

![](/img/coding/Dataprovider.png)

- **Components:**
  - Connection
  - Commands
  - DataReader
  - DataAdapter

| DataProvider | DataReader       | DataAdapter       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| OleDb        | OleDbDataReader  | Ole Db Provider   |
| Sql          | SqlDataReader    | SqlDataAdapter    |
| ODBC         | OdbcDataReader   | OdbcDataAdapter   |
| Oracle       | OracleDataReader | OracleDataAdapter |

- **Sample Code - Fill DataTable & Bind data in control**

~~~
protected void BinddataTable()  
{  
    SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("your database connection string");  
    con.Open();  
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Write your query or procedure", con);  
    SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);  
    DataTable dt = new DataTable();  
    da.Fill(dt);  
    grid.DataSource = dt;  
    grid.DataBind();  
}
~~~

- **Sample Code - Update Database via DataAdapter**

~~~
private static void AdapterUpdate(string connectionString)
{
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        //Initiate DataAdapter
        SqlDataAdapter dataAdpater = new SqlDataAdapter(
          "SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName FROM Categories",
          connection);
		//Define SQL command
        dataAdpater.UpdateCommand = new SqlCommand(
           "UPDATE Categories SET CategoryName = @CategoryName " +
           "WHERE CategoryID = @CategoryID", connection);
        
        //Fill in parameter
        dataAdpater.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add(
           "@CategoryName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 15, "CategoryName");
		//The other way to fill in parameter
        SqlParameter parameter = dataAdpater.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add(
          "@CategoryID", SqlDbType.Int);
        parameter.SourceColumn = "CategoryID";
        parameter.SourceVersion = DataRowVersion.Original;

        DataTable categoryTable = new DataTable();
        dataAdpater.Fill(categoryTable);

        DataRow categoryRow = categoryTable.Rows[0];
        categoryRow["CategoryName"] = "New Beverages";

        dataAdpater.Update(categoryTable);

        Console.WriteLine("Rows after update.");
        foreach (DataRow row in categoryTable.Rows)
        {
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", row[0], row[1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~

- **Sample Code - Using DataSet**

~~~
// Assumes that customerConnection is a valid SqlConnection object.  
// Assumes that orderConnection is a valid OleDbConnection object.  
SqlDataAdapter custAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(  
  "SELECT * FROM dbo.Customers", customerConnection);  
OleDbDataAdapter ordAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(  
  "SELECT * FROM Orders", orderConnection);  
  
DataSet customerOrders = new DataSet();  
  
custAdapter.Fill(customerOrders, "Customers");  
ordAdapter.Fill(customerOrders, "Orders");  
  
DataRelation relation = customerOrders.Relations.Add("CustOrders",  
  customerOrders.Tables["Customers"].Columns["CustomerID"],  
  customerOrders.Tables["Orders"].Columns["CustomerID"]);  
  
foreach (DataRow pRow in customerOrders.Tables["Customers"].Rows)  
{  
  Console.WriteLine(pRow["CustomerID"]);  
   foreach (DataRow cRow in pRow.GetChildRows(relation))  
    Console.WriteLine("\t" + cRow["OrderID"]);  
}  
~~~



> **8 - What is the difference between "Connected" and "Disconnected" Environment?**

| Connected Env                                                | Disconnected Env                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| It requires a **constant** connection to transfer data between the application and database | It doesn't require a constant connection to transfer data between the application and database |
| Data concurrency is easy to control                          | Data concurrency is not easy to control                      |
| Data is up-to-date since user is always connected to the database | Data is not up-to-date since user is always connected to the database |
| It has scalability and performance issues  for the client application | It improves scalability and performance of the client application |
| Lead to network traffic logging                              | Less network traffic logging issues                          |



> **9 - What is the difference between "Typed" and "Untyped Dataset"?**

- **Typed DataSet**: A typed dataset is derived from the Dataset class and has an associated XML schema, which is created at the time of creation of the dataset. The XML schema contains information about the dataset structure.
- **Untyped DataSet**: Untyped dataset doesn’t have an XML schema associated with it. Untyped Dataset, the tables, and columns are represented as a collection.



> **10 - What is DataView?**

- A DataView control creates a customized view of data stored in Datatable. The changes in DataView will affect the Datatable. By default, every table has a data view attached to it.
- You can then add the DataView control and bind it to a Windows form. It allows the user to filter, navigate and sort the data in it.



> **11 - What is SqlTransaction Class?**

- The **SqlTransaction** class ensures that a body of code will affect a Database or kept the same as previous ***(Rollback)***.
  - **Commit():** It commits the transaction. It save changes made in Database during transaction. In simple term we can also say that it shows the end of transaction at that time。
  - **Rollback():** It is used to rollback the transaction. It set the database in previous stage which was, before the begin of transaction.



> **12 - What is ExecuteScalar method?**

- The ExecuteScalar Method in SqlCommandObject returns the first column of the first row after executing the query against the Data Source.
  - If the result set contain more than one column or rows, it takes only the first column of the first row. All other values are ignored.
  - If the result set is empty it will return null.

~~~
Int32 TotalSalary = Convert.ToInt32(sqlcmd.ExecuteScalar());
~~~



> **13 - What is `clone()` and `copy()` method of DataSet?**

- The `clone()` method copy the structure of DataSet. Means it copy only schema not full records of DataSet.
- The `copy()` method copy the whole records with structure of DataSet.



> **14 - What is `clone()` method of DataSet?**

The clone method copy the structure of DataSet. Means it **copy only schema not full records** of DataSet.



> **15 - What are the advantages of ADO.NET?**

- **Single Object-oriented API**

  ADO.NET provides a single object-oriented set of classes. There are different data providers to work with different data sources but the programming model for all these data providers work in the same way.

- **Managed Code**

  The ADO.NET classes are managed classes. CLR takes care of language independency and automatic resource management.

- **Deployment**

  Microsoft uses MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Component), which is used as ActiveX component in .NET Framework (X is extensible component, when X is written after a term means extensible). .NET components takes care of deployment which was difficult than the previous technologies used in deployment.

- **XML Support**

  ADO.NET data is cached and transferred in XML (EXtensible Markup Language) format. XML provide fast access of data for desktop and distributed applications.

- **Performance and scalability**

  Performance and scalability are two major factors while developing web-based application and services. Disconnected cached data in XML help in performance and scalability.



# Entity Framework

> **16 - What is Entity Framework?**

Microsoft Entity Framework (EF) is an **Object Relational Mapping framework** that provides an **abstraction layer** (a kind of mapping) between two incompatible systems (i.e. Object oriented programming languages with Relational databases). It enables us to interact with relational data in an object oriented way, meaning we can retrieve and manipulate data as strongly typed objects using LINQ queries.



> **17 - What are "advantages" and "disadvantages" of Entity Framework?**

- **Advantages**

  - Provides auto generated code
  - Reduce development time therefore reduce development cost
  - Enables developers to visually design models and mapping of database. Easy to map business objects (with drag & drop tables).
  - Provides capability of programming a conceptual model.
  - Provides unique syntax (e.g. LINQ) for all object queries whether it is database or not
  - Allows multiple conceptual models to mapped to a single storage schema

- **Disadvantages**

  - Lazy loading is the main drawbacks of EF
  - Its syntax is complicated
  - Its logical schema is not able to understand business entities and relation among each other
  - It is not available for every RDMS
  - Need to handle data in nontraditional way (a certain level of learning curve)
  - It does not work if we change any schema of the database. We need to update the schema on the solution. (which is fair enough...:smile:)
  - Not the optimal option for huge domain model.

  

> **18 - What is the "Laze Loading" of Entity Framework?**

- **Lazy loading** is the process whereby an entity or collection of entities is automatically loaded from the database the first time that a property referring to the entity/entities is accessed. Lazy loading means **delaying the loading of related data, until you specifically request for it**. EF will always load the minimal amount of data and then will only fetch additional data on an as-needed basis.
- For example the data will only be loaded until you use `ToList()` function below.

~~~
public partial class Student 
{
   public Student() {
      this.Enrollments = new HashSet<Enrollment>();
   }
	
   public int ID { get; set; }
   public string LastName { get; set; }
   public string FirstMidName { get; set; }
   public System.DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
   //Noted the key word "virtual" here
   public virtual ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }
}

class Program 
{
   static void Main(string[] args) 
   {
      using (var context = new UniContextEntities()) 
      {
         //Loading students only
         IList<Student> students = context.Students.ToList<Student>();
         //...
      }
   }
}	
~~~

- Lazy loading and **serialization** don’t mix well, and if you aren’t careful you can end up querying for your entire database just because lazy loading is enabled. It’s a good practice to turn lazy loading off before you serialize an entity.

~~~
public partial class Student { 

   public Student() { 
      this.Enrollments = new HashSet<Enrollment>(); 
   }
	
   public int ID { get; set; } 
   public string LastName { get; set; } 
   public string FirstMidName { get; set; } 
   public System.DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
   //REMOVE "virtual"
   public ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; } 
}
~~~

- May also disable all entities in the context by setting a flag on the Configuration property to false as shown below

~~~
public partial class UniContextEntities : DbContext 
{ 
   public UniContextEntities(): base("name = UniContextEntities") 
   {
      this.Configuration.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;
   }
	
   protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder) 
   { 
      throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstException(); 
   } 
}
~~~



> **19 - Where do we use Virtual classes in EF DbContext Models?**

- We use Virtual classes in EF in context class where we define `DbSet` of corresponding table. As we can see easily in below code sample for Students and Departments: 

~~~
public partial class StudentEntities : DbContext
{
	public StudentEntities() : base("name=StudentEntities") { }
	
	protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder mb)
	{ throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstExeption(); }
	//Noted "virtual" here
	public virtual DbSet<Department> Depts { get; set; }
	public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
~~~



> **20 - What is the difference between `DbContext` and `ObjectContext`?**

- **ObjectContext** and **DbContext** have the capability to query and work with data as objects. Additionally Dbcontext can be represented as a combination of the Unit of Work and Repository patterns. Conceptually DbContext is the same as ObjectContext.
- **ObjectContext** : A class that manages all the database operations, like database connection, and manages various entities of the Entity Model. Responsible for:
  - Database connection
  - Provides built-in Add, Update and Delete functions
  - Object Set of every entity
  - Provide State of pending changes
  - It holds the changes done in entities
- **DbContext** : Conceptually similar to ObjectContext. DbContext is nothing but a ObjectContext wrapper, we can say it is a lightweight alternative to the ObjectContext. Can be used for `DataBase first`, `code first` and `model first` development. Mainly contains a set of APIs that are very easy to use.

| ObjectContext                                                | DbContext                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| part of the core EF API, that allows us to perform queries, change and track updates of the Database by using **strongly typed** entity classes. | Can be described as a wrapper of ObjectContext. It exposes the most commonly used features of ObjectContext. |
| Supports Compiled Queries                                    | Does not                                                     |
| Supports self-tracking of Entities                           | Does not                                                     |
| only useful in `Model First` and `Database First` approaches | useful in `Model First`, `Database First` approach as well as `Code First` approach. |
| Not thread-safe.                                             | Any public static (C#) or Shared (VB) members of DbContext are thread-safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe. |

~~~
// using ObjectContext (EF4.0)
using (Entities context = new Entities())
{
        IEnumerable<EmployeeDetails> empDetails =  
            context.ExecuteStoreQuery<EmployeeDetails>("exec GetEmployeeData").ToList();
}

// using DBContext (EF 4.1 and above)
using (Entities context = new Entities())
{
        IEnumerable<EmployeeDetails> empDetails  =  
            context.Database.SqlQuery<EmployeeDetails>("exec GetEmployeeData ", null).ToList();
}
~~~



> **21 - What are the development approaches are supported in EF?**

- **Code First** - Where code defines the database. EF handles creation. A complete detailed implementation of EF Code First Approach [here](<http://www.webdevelopmenthelp.net/2016/11/mvc-with-ef6-code-first.html>).
- **Database First** - Regular approach used where database is first created or already exists.
- **Model First** - Model is drawn first that further generate database scripts



> **22 - What is the difference between EF and ADO.NET?**

| Entity Framework                                            | ADO.NET                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Around the ADO.NET, which means ADO.NET is faster than EF   | Faster                                         |
| Easy to use. EF will talk to DB without much code involved. | Need to write so much code to talk to database |
| Lower performance compare with ADO.NET                      | Better performance                             |



> **23 - What is the difference between EF and LINQ to SQL?**

| Entity Framework                                             | LINQ to SQL                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Supports databases like SQL, MySQL, DB2, etc.                | Supports only for SQL DB                                     |
| Allows 1-to-1, 1-to-n and n-to-n mappings between the Entity classes and the relational tables | Allows only 1-to-1 mapping between classes and the relational tables |
| Relationships are maintained in 3 different files - *.csdl/msl/ssdl | *.dbml file is generated for maintaining the relationships   |

| Supports rapid application development with SQL, MySQL, DB2, etc. | Supports rapid application development with SQL only         |



> **24 - What is LINQ to Entities?**

- LINQ to Entities is a query language which we used to write queries against the object models and the query result will return the entities defined in the Conceptual Model. 
- There are 3 parts of Entity Data Model (*.EDMX file): 
  - **Conceptual module** - the model classes which contain the relationships. These are independent of the database design.​
  - **Mapping** - will have the information on how the Conceptual Models are mapped to Storage Models
  - **Storage Model** - are database design models, which contains database tables, views, stored procedures and keys with relationships

~~~
using (AdventureWorksEntities context = new AdventureWorksEntities())
{
    IQueryable<string> productNames =
        from p in context.Products
        select p.Name;

    Console.WriteLine("Product Names:");
    foreach (String productName in productNames)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(productName);
    }
}
~~~



> **25 - What is LINQ to SQL?**

Provides a run-time infrastructure for managing relational data as objects. The data model of a relational database is mapped to an object model expressed in the programming language of the developer.

~~~
// Northwnd inherits from System.Data.Linq.DataContext.
Northwnd nw = new Northwnd(@"northwnd.mdf");
// or, if you are not using SQL Server Express
// Northwnd nw = new Northwnd("Database=Northwind;Server=server_name;Integrated Security=SSPI");

var companyNameQuery =
    from cust in nw.Customers 
    where cust.City == "London"
    select cust.CompanyName;

foreach (var customer in companyNameQuery)
{
    Console.WriteLine(customer);
}
~~~



> **26 - What is the difference among `LINQ to Entities`, `LINQ to SQL` and `LINQ to Dataset`?**

All of them are LINQ - Language Integrated Query. So they all share a lot of commonality. All these *dialects* basically allow you to do a query-style select of data, from various sources.

- **Linq-to-SQL** is Microsoft's first attempt at an ORM - Object-Relational Mapper. It supports SQL Server only. It's a mapping technology to map SQL Server database tables to .NET objects.
- **Linq-to-Entities** is the same idea, but using Entity Framework in the background, as the ORM - again from Microsoft, but supporting multiple database backends.
- **Linq-to-DataSets** is LINQ, but using is against the "old-style" ADO.NET 2.0 DataSets - in the times before ORM's from Microsoft, all you could do with ADO.NET was returning DataSets, DataTables etc., and Linq-to-DataSets queries those data stores for data. So in this case, you'd return a DataTable or DataSets (System.Data namespace) from a database backend, and then query those using the LINQ syntax



> **27 - what all scenarios Entity Framework can be applicable?**

- If you have existing database already or you want to build your database first than other parts of the application
- If your prime focus is your domain classes and then create the database from your domain classes
- If you want to design your database schema on the visual designer and create the classes and database



> **28 - How to improve performance of EF?**

Some best practices below:

- Try to avoid to put all the DB objects into one single entity model
- Disable change tracking for entity if not needed
- Reduce response time for the first request by using pre-generating Views
- If not required try to avoid fetching all the fields
- For data manipulation select appropriate collection
- Wherever needed use compiled query
- Avoid using Views and Contains
- While binding data to grid or paging, retrieve only required no of records
- Debug and Optimize LINQ query



> **29 - How can you load related entities in EF**

There are 3 ways below:

- **Eager Loading** - is the process whereby a query for one type of entity also loads related entities as part of the query. Eager loading is achieved by use of the Include method. For example, the queries below will load blogs and all the posts related to each blog.

~~~
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    // Load all blogs and related posts
    var blogs1 = context.Blogs
                        .Include(b => b.Posts)
                        .ToList();

    // Load one blogs and its related posts

- **Lazy Loading** - is the process whereby an entity or collection of entities is automatically loaded from the database the first time that a property referring to the entity/entities is accessed. When using POCO entity types, lazy loading is achieved by creating instances of derived proxy types and then overriding virtual properties to add the loading hook. *Refer to prior sample code.*

- **Explicit Loading** - Even with lazy loading disabled it is still possible to lazily load related entities, but it must be done with an explicit call. To do so you use the Load method on the related entity’s entry.

~~~
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var post = context.Posts.Find(2);

    // Load the blog related to a given post
    context.Entry(post).Reference(p => p.Blog).Load();

    // Load the blog related to a given post using a string  
    context.Entry(post).Reference("Blog").Load();

    var blog = context.Blogs.Find(1);

    // Load the posts related to a given blog
    context.Entry(blog).Collection(p => p.Posts).Load();

    // Load the posts related to a given blog  
    // using a string to specify the relationship
    context.Entry(blog).Collection("Posts").Load();
}

> **30 - What do you think about using "Laze Loading" of EF in ASP.NET project?**

**Better to turn it off in ASP.NET**  --> ​refer to [this thread](<https://ardalis.com/avoid-lazy-loading-entities-in-asp-net-applications>)

Suppose you have a simple object model that involves several related entities. Let’s say you have a conference web site and you want to display a list of Sessions (presentations). Each Session can have one or more Speaker. And each Session may have one or more Tag. An EF6 object model might look like this:

~~~
public abstract class BaseEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
 
public class Speaker : BaseEntity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
 
    public virtual List<SpeakerSession> SpeakerSessions { get; set; } = new List<SpeakerSession>();
}
 
public class SpeakerSession : BaseEntity
{
    public int SpeakerId { get; set; }
    public virtual Speaker Speaker { get; set; }
    public int SessionId { get; set; }
    public virtual Session Session { get; set; }
}
 
public class Session : BaseEntity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public virtual List<SpeakerSession> SpeakerSessions { get; set; } = new List<SpeakerSession>();
    public virtual List<SessionTag> SessionTags { get; set; } = new List<SessionTag>();
}
 
public class SessionTag: BaseEntity
{
    public int SessionId { get; set; }
    public virtual Session Session { get; set; }
    public int TagId { get; set; }
    public virtual Tag Tag { get; set; }
}
 
public class Tag : BaseEntity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual List<SessionTag> SessionTags { get; set; } = new List<SessionTag>();
}
~~~

Now let’s look at what’s involved to display a page like this one:

![](/img/coding/lazyloading.asp.net.png)

This simple demo page has 3 sessions on it, one of which has 2 tags. Two of the sessions have one speaker, and one has two speakers.

**Question**: How many database queries should be required to render this page?

- **Ideally, 0**, because the page will be cached, but that’s a bit of a non-answer. There are plenty of examples of data that can’t or shouldn’t be cached, but which has relationships similar to what’s shown here. So, if we can’t escape hitting the database by using caching, where does that leave us? How many queries should it require?

- **Ideally, just one**. Database queries are expensive within web requests. Every round trip eats up a lot of time and adds to the total time the user is waiting before their browser even gets back a response and can start the work of rendering the page (and loading its zillion scripts, CSS files, and images that most sites have today). Also, if you’re planning on running in a cloud environment, be careful you’re not using a data plan that charges per-query (instead of or in addition to per-hour for the database instance). Your costs can quickly skyrocket if you’re using lazy loading and per-query pricing!

So, we’d like to see this page load with a single query. At most maybe a couple because of all the joins involved. But if we go from 3 sessions to 40 or 100 we shouldn’t see the database queries multiply by a factor of 10, too. How do we know how many queries are being executed?

Now, before we get to the query count, let’s look at how the page is implemented. The **controller** is very simple:

~~~
private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db = new ApplicationDbContext();
public ActionResult Index()
{
    var sessions = _db.Sessions;
    return View(sessions);
}
~~~

The view just takes the Sessions types and loops through them, joining if necessary for results that may have multiple values (speakers, tags). Incidentally, this is a good solution to the “how do I avoid having a trailing comma in my list” problem. This is the whole `Index.cshtml` view file. When this page is rendered, it makes **22 queries to the database**. 

~~~
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}
@model IEnumerable<LazyLoadingMvc5.Models.Session>
 
<h2>Sessions</h2>
 
@foreach (var session in Model)
{
    <div class="row">
        <h3>@session.Name</h3>
        <h4>@string.Join(",", session.SpeakerSessions?.Select(ss => ss.Speaker.Name).ToArray())
        </h4>
        <h4>
            @string.Join(",", session.SessionTags?.Select(st => st.Tag.Name).ToArray())           </h4>
        <p>@session.Description</p>
    </div>
}
~~~

Now, what if you run the equivalent sample using EF Core, which doesn’t use (or currently support) lazy loading? The code needs to be updated slightly to ensure the related entities are eagerly loaded (otherwise they will be null):

~~~
private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db;
public SessionsController(ApplicationDbContext db)
{
    _db = db;
}
public IActionResult Index()
{
    var sessions = _db.Sessions
        .Include(s => s.SessionTags)
        .ThenInclude(st => st.Tag)
        .Include(s => s.SpeakerSessions)
        .ThenInclude(ss=>ss.Speaker);
    return View(sessions);
}
~~~

Loading the same page, with the same data, logging to the console, yields these results. the same page now loads with just 3 queries. We’re not down to 1, but this is a huge improvement over 22 queries.
