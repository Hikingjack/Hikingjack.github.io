## 杂念

-------



在软件行业混迹了几年后，多少会对`Agile`和`Scrum`之类的概念有所耳闻，很多团队也可能在潜移默化中尝试了很多敏捷的最佳实践，仅仅是没有很笃定地用敏捷来描述自己团队的运作模式。

如果你用过Redmine, Rally, Jira, Pivotal Tracker，或者是使用过`User story`来描述用户需求，再或者是定期参加各种老板、组长组织的某些每日晨会，那你很可能已经沉浸在“敏捷”之中有些日子了。

PMI-ACP认证是最初始于2012年，相比Scrum联盟的认证不算是新，很多人甚至早已有了CSM或者CSO的认证。不过，PMI-ACP可以说是全面了解、理解进而系统实践“敏捷思想”的最佳途径之一，至少对我本人是这样的。

“敏捷”不需要死记硬背，更重要的是领会和在工作、生活中的灵活实践。但出于认证考试的目的，有一个索引列表也是极好的。在最近备考PMI-ACP的过程中，整理了一些日常笔记，仅供个人学习，难免有所疏漏，但希望能方便快速查阅，对备考有所帮助。

目前PMI-ACP考试还没有支持中文考试系统，所以用英文整理。😄

27. **Product Backlog**  
A list of all things that needs to be done within the project. It replaces the traditional requirements spec artifacts. It includes content, availability and ordering. It’s never complete. It can have a tech nature or can be user-centric. PO is responsible for it.
28. **Sprint Backlog**  
A set of the product backlog items selected for this sprint PLUS the plan for delivering them. The dev team determines this list with PO’s explanation and assistance.
29. **Increment**  
The sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and all previous sprints. At the end of sprint, the new increment must be Done.
30. **Definition of Done**  
DoD means each backlog items has acceptance criteria that define measurably what must be met when the item is declared to be done. A shared understanding of Scrum team on the meaning of work to be complete.

34. **Theme**  
A set of user story and grouped together that fall under the same category
35. **User story**
	- A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability

Cards / Conversation / Confirmation
38. **Backlog Item**  
A unit of work, usually a story or a task that listed on the project backlog. Defined by PO
39. **Backlog Grooming**   
Also called **`Refinement`**. At the end of one sprint, the team and PO meet to make sure the backlog is ready for the next sprint. The team may remove user stories that aren’t relevant, create new stories, reassess the priority of stories, or split user stories into small tasks. The purpose is to ensure the backlog only contains items that are relevant and detailed, and that meet project objectives.
40. **Scrum Taskboard / Storyboard**  
The team makes the sprint backlog visible by putting it on a Scrum task board and updates it continuously throughout the sprint
41. **Burndown Chart**  
A visual tool which focuses on **`How much work left`** in the project. It’s used to measure the progress of an agile project at both an iteration and project level. It can warm the team if things aren’t going according to plan and help to show the impact of decisions.
42. **Burnup Chart**  
A visual tool which focuses on **`How much work has been completed`** and total amount of work for a project or iteration. It’s used to track team progress and to show any scope change in the mid-project
43. **Scrum of Scrums**  
A technique to scale Scrum up to large groups.  Each daily scrum within a sub-team ends by designating one member as "ambassador" to participate in a daily meeting with ambassadors from other teams to report completions, next steps and impediments on behalf of the teams they represent. The Scrum of Scrums will track these challenges/solutions via a backlog of its own, where each item contributes to improving between-team coordination.
44. **Feature Creep**  
Occurs when a software becomes complicated and difficult to use as a result of too many feature
45. **Evolutionary design**  
The practice of letting the design emerge from well written and refactored code. No big upfront design is done.

47. **MMF - Minimum marketable feature**  
The smallest set of functionality that must be realized in order for the customer to perceive value. Is characterized by the 3 attributes: Minimum, Marketable and Feature. A feature is something that is perceived, of itself, as value by the user. `Marketable` means that it provides significant value to the customer; value may include revenue generation, cost savings, competitive differentiation, brand-name projection, or enhanced customer loyalty. A release is a collection of MMFs that can be delivered together within the timeframe.
48. **MVP - Minimum viable product**  
A concept of Lean Startup that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. Version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. The key premise behind MVP is that you produce and actual product that you can offer the customers and observe their actual behavior with the product and service.

		- SM/PM to coach behaviors, act as a resource person to team, calm work environment and develop mutual trust.
	- **Norming**
		- Emotions settle down and every individual personality takes its place in the team, differences are resolved and the team members’ individual strengths are starting to compliment each other. – begin to trust each other and work towards the goal.
		- SM/PM to empower behaviors, get feedback from members, allow for the transfer of leadership
	- **Performing**

	- **Product version** – `review once a year`. Created by PO describing what the product is, who will and why use it, and how the product supports organizational strategy
	- **Product roadmap** – `review twice a year`. Create by PO describing the high-level product requirements, timeframes for deliverables, prioritization and estimations. It’s a visual overview of all the releases and major components. Can be in form of story maps – a diagram indicating the sequences of walking skeleton and optional feature to be released over time.
	- **Release plan** – `revised twice/four times a year`. Created by PO describing the high-level timeline for product releases
	- **Sprint plan / Iteration plan** – `revised in each iteration`. Created by PO, SM and Dev team describing sprint goals, tasks to complete, and Definition of Done.

69. **Theory of Constrains (TOC)**  
Changes to most of the variables in an organization usually have only small impacts on global performance
70. **MoSCow**  
A concept of prioritization - Must / Should / Could / Won't
71. **Dot-Voting**  
Aka `democracy`. Using a limited number of stickers or marks with pens. A form of cumulative voting. A quick and simple method for prioritizing a long list of options
